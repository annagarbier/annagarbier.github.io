					<p><b>User Interface Critique: VoiceOver</b><br><br>
					Like most smartphones today, my phone uses visual signifiers, mappings, and feedback events to communicate its affordances and guide the user through an effective and enjoyable user experience. Of course, there are some audio and haptic moments, but my experience with the phone is largely visual: when I first unlock it, a grid of icons signify an array of actions I can take (e.g. sending a message, playing music, hailing a ride, changing the settings); a line of dots serve as my navigation "map" so that I can see where I am in my several pages of icons; and when I tap or swipe using any of this information, the screen’s visual content changes accordingly. This visual change shows me that I’ve "moved", that I'm now acting in a new virtual context.
					<br><br>
					I can discover and use nearly all of my phone's functionality through sight, taps, and swipes. This experience is the result of thoughtful design that happens to work well for me. For visually impaired users though, the particular design-- heavily dependent on visual signifiers, mappings, and feedback-- fails. The phone's "core" design leaves visually impaired users with a phone whose affordances are largely lost.
					<br><br>
					To recover the phone's affordances for visually impaired users, my phone has a screen reader called VoiceOver. This technology replaces the visual signifiers, mappings, and feedback with audio and haptic alternatives. For example, instead of seeing a grid of icons on the home screen, I can scroll my finger across the home screen and hear the application names read out loud as my finger touches them (e.g. "iMessage [pause] double tap to open"). Instead of seeing a series of dots that serve my navigation map, the reader announces my location (e.g. "page two of four"). And when I double tap on an application that I want to use, a distinct noise signals that the application has been opened, that I've changed contexts, and that I'm now able to explore this new page by touch.
					<br><br>
					Having spent the day with VoiceOver enabled, I'm struck by two observations: first, everything I wanted to do, I technically could do. And second, nothing felt as polished as my typical experience. I couldn't use the phone with one hand; I couldn't swipe type; I couldn't tell the difference between an incoming "Okay!" text message compared to "Okay."; and every page's content was read starting with the top left corner, even though that’s rarely where the header or main content is when pages are designed. It was impossible not to feel as though the phone was designed first as a visual display with visual signifiers, mappings, and feedback-- and only later was a voice added to read this visual logic out loud; in fact, the name "VoiceOver" does little to mask this reality.
					<br><br>
					In light of our recent readings around co-design, "futuring", and equitable design, I've been wondering what today's smartphone would be like if it were designed from scratch for visually impaired users. What would be different? Can we do better than adding a perfectly-functional-though-not-exactly-delightful audio bandaid over a well-designed visual experience?
