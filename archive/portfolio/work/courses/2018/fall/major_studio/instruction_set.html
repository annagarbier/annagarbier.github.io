	        	We visited the Fort Greene farmers market on a fall day to observe the space and its interactions. We paid particular attention to interactions around the produce (touching, stacking, weighing, tasting), and to interactions around a prominent stone wall that lines the market's edge (climbing, looking over, leaning against, sitting upon).

			<p><span class="project-subheader">Part 2: Create non-textual instruction sets for a public space</span><br>
	        	Embracing the fall season, and remembering kids hugging pumpkins in our earlier visit, we decide to play with this observed pumpkin interaction. What if a pumpkin didn't just have a carved face, but that face could talk with you?
			</p>
			<p class="code">
		        // This p5.js code executes a "live-coded" conversation between<br>
				// a human and a pumpkin, created for the purposes of<br>
				// exploring what that interaction might feel like for a user.<br><br>
		        let speech = new p5.Speech();<br>
				let counter = 0;<br><br>

				function setup() {<br>
					createCanvas(100, 100);<br>
				}<br><br>

				function mousePressed() {<br>
					speech.setVoice('Google US English');<br><br>

					if (counter == 0) {<br>
						speech.speak('Hello');<br>
						counter += 1;<br><br>

					} else if (counter == 1) {<br>
						speech.speak('How\'s it going?');<br>
						counter += 1;<br><br>

					} else if (counter == 2) {<br>
						speech.speak('Looks like you\'re enjoying the market.');<br>
						counter += 1;<br><br>

		    <p><span class="project-subheader">Part 3: Prototyping, Testing, Iterating, Documenting</span><br>
	        	We set up a small stand of interactive jack-o-lanterns to the market. The pumpkins' had two coded affordances: they could play a variety of music or they could say a variety of greetings. In each case, the user had to lift the lid to begin the interaction.<br><br>Between iterations, we played with number of pumpkins and loction of pumpkins. In each case, we found our signifiers to be either not there at all or too weak to overcome an apparent "jack-o-lanterns aren't for touching" intertia. In future iterations, it's clear we needed to focus more on creating opportunities to <i>begin</i> the interaction. Once past this barrier, we observed that the users stayed with the interaction.
