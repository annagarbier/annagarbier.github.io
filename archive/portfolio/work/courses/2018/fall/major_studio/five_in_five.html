				Create one project per day for five consecutive days. Each project must include conceptualization, production and documentation.

	    	When we speak to each other, we create soundwaves that pass through the air and-- assuming someone's there to listen-- hit a listener's ear. But what if those sounds, rather than running their course and disappearing, were made material? 
	    	<br><br>
			This thought exercise draws on the parallels between organic structures in the physical world and the structures of language. It's an unusual, but logically-driven, data visualization.

	    	<i>"The possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things....We were happy with ourselves....[and then] I realized we had missed something, which is the rest of the planet."</i> - Neil Gershenfeld

	        In the spirit of engaging with both animals and computation, generative drawings use Processing to visualize whale vocalizations. Inspired by this <a href="http://responsivedesign.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tutorial-06_processing-soundmapping2.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Crafting</a> tutorial, these ink-like "signatures" map to distinct soundss.

	    	<i>"Two types of blinks, two vowel sounds, two different anything, really, can with suitable combinations convey all types of information."</i> - Charles Petzold, The Hidden Language of Computer Software (2000)

	        In this Arduino project, a set of six LEDs are programmed to display the words, "hello world" using Braille's six-dot convention. Materials include an Arduino Uno, Breadboard, 6 LED lights and supporting wires and breakers.

	    	<i>"At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a loud-speaker."</i> - Vannevar Bush, As We May Think (1945)"
	        <br><br>
			This Processing project starts with the question: if I were going to make myself a personal Voder, how would I do it? My self-imposed requirements are: it has to be playable with my hands (even if via a keyboard) and I must have manual control of every sound sequence.

	    	<i>"It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything."</i> - Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action (1945) 
			<br><br>
			Using a 1:1 mapping, this block of emojis encodes the preamble to the Constitution of the United States. Though an emoji alphabet is ridiculous in practice (nobody really wants to read or write like this), it does demonstrate Hayakawa's point: we can make anything stand for anything. We can even make emojis stand for complex, constitutional principles of justice, tranquility, and blessings for ourselves and our posterity.</p>
