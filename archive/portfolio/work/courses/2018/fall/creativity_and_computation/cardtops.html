		<p class="image-caption">Why public transportation cards as AR targets? 1) widely accessible 2) situated as part of a distinct local culture and experience 3) available in times of boredom 4) technically easy for machine to recognize which allows for more freedom when deisgning interactions</p>

		<p class="image-caption">Playing with card interactions: tapping, flipping, bending, and covering the AR target. Thinking about user considerations: e.g. Should it be a one-handed interaction? How much space will they have to move?. As well as technical considerations: e.g. What kind of target interaction can Unity & Vuforia reliably understand?</p>

		<p class="image-caption">Ultimately chose to use the card as a platform that exists in 3d space. As the user moves this platform, a mini game plays out accordingly.</p>

			<b>Future Iterations</b><br>
			I'd like to build a "system" of mini-games that plays off of transportation as a system. Maybe these games engage with local attractions/businesses, or maybe they lead to collectable "tokens" as you use different cities' transportation systems.
