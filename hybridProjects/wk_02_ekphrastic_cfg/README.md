# Dutch Masterpieces (CFG style)

A dozen [ekphrastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekphrasis) texts from [The Met's Dutch Masterpieces](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/in-praise-of-painting-dutch-masterpieces) collection are procedurally woven together using [context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). The result? A series of fictional paintings to ponder (or paint!).

Created by Anna Garbier, using Kate Compton's [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) library.

## Example output

```txt
STILL LIFE
A table laid with imported luxuries, an almanac, and a type
of glass known as a roemer invites the viewer to associate
visual and luxurious pleasure. But a closer look reveals
crumbling objects of veneration, a reminder of life's brevity.

PORTRAIT
Two women of different ages sit on upholstered chairs. The
elder, with a sausage dangling from her cap, writes a letter
while the younger peers over her shoulder. Perhaps the older
woman is helping her friend craft a response to a suitor.

LANDSCAPE
A pavilion bisects the foreground of this painting, dividing
the woods on the left from a respectable home on the right.
Various figures—horses, a young woman strumming a lute, and
a wayfarer seeking alms—add anecdotal interest to the scene.
