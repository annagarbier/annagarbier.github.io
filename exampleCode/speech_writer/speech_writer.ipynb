Round your lips so that they create a small opening. With your lips in this position, raise the back of your tongue towards the back of the roof of your mouth. Keep a little space between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. Release air through your mouth. As you do all so, keep your vocal folds tense. Move your tongue slightly towards the middle of the roof of your mouth. Tense your vocal folds and push air through your mouth.

Keeping your tongue firmly in this position, tense your vocal folds and release air so that the air moves across the sides of your tongue. Touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth at your gum line, just behind your top teeth. Create a tight constriction and allow air pressure to build inside your mouth. Quickly lower your tongue, releasing the air pressure in a short burst. As you do so, keep your vocal folds tense.'"
