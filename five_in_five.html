				<p class="project-title">Day 1: Let's agree that emojis can stand for justice and tranquility</p>
				<p><i>It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything.</i><br>
				- Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action (1945)
				<br><br>This block of "emoji text" was created by taking the Constitution of the United States of America, and replacing all Latin letters (e.g. 'a') with an emoji counterpart (e.g. ':expressionless:') using 1:1 mappings.
				<br><br>
				Though ridiculous in practice, this transliteration demonstrates Hayawaka's proposition in the extreme: we can (at least from a logical encoding perspective) make anything stand for anything. We can even make emojis stand for complex, constitutional principles of <i>justice</i>, <i>tranquility</i>, and <i>blessings for ourselves and our posterity</i>. Much as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images" target="_blank">painting of a pipe was not the pipe</a>, written symbols are not the ideas; they just stand for them. 

				<br><br>Notes and Resources:
				<ul>
					<li>Original preamble text: <i>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</i></li>
					<li>Emojis were downloaded from <a href="https://www.emojione.com/emoji/v4" target="_blank">EmojiOne</a>.</li>
					<li>Future iterations: make this web-interactive using p5.js, and possibly with audio components.</li>
