	          	<p><i>It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything.</i><br><br>
	          	- Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action (1945)
	          	<br><br>
	          	<hr>
	          	<p>This "emoji text" was created by taking the Constitution of the United States of America, and replacing all Latin letters (e.g. 'a') with an emoji counterpart (e.g. ':expressionless:') using 1:1 mappings.
	          	<br><br>
	          	Though ridiculous in practice, this emoji text demonstrates the idea that we can (at least from a logical encoding perspective) make anything stand for anything. We can even make emojis stand for complex, constitutional principles of <i>justice</i>, <i>tranquility</i>, and <i>blessings for ourselves and our posterity</i>.

	          		<li>Emojis were downloaded from <a href="https://www.emojione.com/emoji/v4" target="_blank">EmojiOne</a>.</li>
