	          	<p><i>It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything.</i><br>
	          	- Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action (1945)
	          	<br><br>
	          	<p>This block of emojis spells out the preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America. You can read it from the top left, moving right across each row. The key shows that ':face_with_monocle:' maps to 'w', ':blushing:' maps to 'e', making the word 'we'...and so on for the full text:
	          	<br><br>
	          	<i>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</i>
	          	<br><br>
	          	Though an emoji alphabet is ridiculous in practice (nobody really wants to read or write like this), it does demonstrates Hayakawa's point: we can make anything stand for anything. We can even make emojis stand for complex, constitutional principles of <i>justice</i>, <i>tranquility</i>, and <i>blessings for ourselves and our posterity</i>.
	          	<br><br>This is the beginning of semiotics in humans.
