			Originally trained as a linguist, I am now pursuing a Masters of Fine Arts degree in <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/" target="_blank">Design and Technology</a> at Parsons School of Design. I'm especially interested in communication-- between humans and humans, and between humans and machines. Prior to Parsons, I worked on natural language processing at Google, first as a data operations program manager and later as a computational linguist.
