    <h1>Rewilding</h1>

    <div class="text-content">
        <p>In 2007, fifty or so nature-related
            words were removed from the Oxford Junior Dictionary, including <i>acorn, bluebell,
            kingfisher, lark, and mistletoe</i>. Among the words added were <i>blog,
            broadband, chatroom, MP3 player, and voicemail.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Several writers have, in the years since, responded to this
            particular event through essays and wonderfully dense glossaries
            of the natural world. <span class="title">Rewilding</span> joins those voices as a set of
            procedurally-generated botanical drawings that celebrate our
            vocabulary (both linguistic and visual) for nature: from the poetic
            to the strange to the precise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each imagined plant name was randomly generated based a glossary
            of common plant names (both extinct and living). The drawings
            then followed. These are, in Robert Macfarlane's words, a small
            attempt at "rewilding" our vocabulary-- and with it our imaginations.   
        </p>
