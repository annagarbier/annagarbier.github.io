                Computational writing snippets

                The following are notes for an ongoing computational writing project,
                updated periodically.</i>

            <p class="long-text">
                Over the past year, I created several mini text generation programs.
                Through these programs, I tested different generative methods including
                basic string operations, Markov models, context-free grammars, and neural
                networks. Because none of these programs can generate language out of
                nothing, I also tested various input texts: I fed my language-hungry
                programs everything from novels, to Craigslist ads, to restaurant menus,
                to simple lists of words.
            </p>
            <p class="long-text">
                These exercises resulted in little narrative "snapshots" made mostly
                of existing language around us. For example, a book review made of
                wine descriptions, a tale of recycled goods from Craigslist,
                an imaginary still-life from the Met collections:
            </p>
            <p class="text-snippet">
                The book deals with angular and epic themes like putting a
                triangle in your mouth over and over again.

                because it's old<br>
                because I want a smaller one<br>
                because I'm moving<br>
                because my wife left<br>
                because I need them to go to a good home

                A table laid with lobsters, a lemon peel, and lush fruit invites the
                viewer to associate visual and indulgent pleasure. But a closer look reveals
                broken mantle-pieces nearly hidden in shadow, a reminder of luxury's brevity.
            </p>
            <p class="long-text">
                Along the way, I've also wondered whether a particular
                programming language may guide me towards specific types
                of computational writing. I added different languages into
                the mix. For example, the same little program written in Perl,
                Python, and Clojure.

                What next? I'll be creating a longer-form generative piece
                written in Clojure that builds new narratives from the everyday
                language of the Internet (e.g. restaurant menus, user manuals, reviews).
