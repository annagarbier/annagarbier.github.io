				Identify domains of interest, and explore those domains through project-based responses across a range of media: from 1D (writing) to 5D (user interaction). As we move through these projects, we ask whether the form of inquiry affects the core nature of the work.

			These cacti are programmed to playfully interact with light (for the amusement of us, humans). Technically speaking, their <i>pots</i> have photoresistors that pick up light signals and send the signals to a computer that processes the input and generates an output. <b>Turn sound on for full effect</b>.

			Sound (a time-based dimension) is added back over the spectrograms. Although this was less successful as an artifact in itself, it did prompt useful critique. Specifically, I left this critique ready to loosen the constraints I'd put on myself going forward.</p>

			These spectrograms visualizes three dimensions of sound (time, frequency, intensity), each on their own axis. The sounds come from the <a href="http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/" target="_blank">BBC Sound Effects library</a>, and the spectrograms were generated using <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Experiments" target="_blank">Chrome Music Lab software</a>. Each image is accompanied by a caption that describes the audio scene, as written in the BBC library.

			This brainstorming exercise identifies three initial domains to explore: natural language processing, interspecies communicaiton, and generative drawing.<br><br>
	    	The initial exploration in 1D (writing) can be read <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwNFcp1S4QTLPXcZ6mSouCREJq0QK7peGRIoXaTbMD8/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">here</a></b>, with access to a New School account.
