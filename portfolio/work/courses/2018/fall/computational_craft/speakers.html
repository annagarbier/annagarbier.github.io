			<p class="project-title">Speakers Swatches</p>
			<p>
				These speaker "swatches" are made of vellum, and a copper tape coil. When an audio signal is sent through the coil, a fluctuating magnetic field is created. When this field interacts with a magnet, electrical energy is converted into vibrations in the vellum, which then causes vibrations in the surrounding. Those vibrations in air are what we perceive as sound.

	    <p class="image-caption">The copper coil, wound tightly, acts as an electromagnet. When we send an audio signal through this electromagnet, we create a fluctuating magnetic field. This field interacts with a magnet, causing the vellum to vibrate. When the vellum vibrates, it moves the air around it: this systemmatic movement of air is what we perceive as sound.</p>
