		<p class="image-caption">41 hand-cut foam buttons control three woven pressure sensors using conducive tape and velostat. All buttons are covered in flocked fabric, and sit on top of a wood frame which holds a removable arduino and board. The pressure sensors are read into <a href="./resources/arduino_midterm.pde" target="_blank">Processing code</a> to produce a "pop" sound when one or more of the buttons is pressed.</p>
