    <p>
        I am a creative technologist, artist, and linguist based in New York City.
        I am interested in the patterns of nature and the beauty of code.
        My current projects at Parsons School of Design bring these interests together through
        explorations in natural language processing, communication, and generative art.

        Before joining Parsons as an MFA student in Design and Technology,
        I worked on language technologies at Google and studied Linguistics at Stanford.
